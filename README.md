# EB-Comp-Challenge-1

## Overview

The goal of this Static Comp Challenge was to reproduce a website using primarily HTML and CSS. We had to fit the styling and template details of a webpage that was given to us as a model. I needed to write the HTML and then apply CSS styling to try and match the model as closely as I could. We were given creative freedom with copy, images, icons, and color. 

Below you will see the model (original) website we were given to follow:

## My Project
